						<p>Participants involved with the University of Massachusetts, Outing Club should be aware of the possible risks that are inherent in nature for some activities. These risks include, but are not limited to, the potential for accidents or illness while traveling to and from events, as well as participating in various club activities. Every attempt should be made to minimize the existing risks through the use of proper equipment, safe facilities under the Universityâ€™s control, and sound safety practices.
